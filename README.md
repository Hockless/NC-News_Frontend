# NC NEWS

## A Northcoders student project by James Hockless

Northcoders News is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. It has several functionalities, including the ability to post comments, delete comments, pull up articles, topics and more. For this project, I built both the backend and frontend using most of the skills I have previously listed. Northcoders News has articles which are divided into topics. Each article has user curated ratings and can be up or down voted using the API.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
