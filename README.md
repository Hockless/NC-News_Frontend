# NC News -- Frontend

This is the frontend for the online aggregation site 'NC News'. 

## Description

Northcoders News is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. It has several functionalities, including the ability to post comments, delete comments, pull up articles, topics and more. For this project, I built both the backend and frontend using a combination of tools, including Express, React, PSQL, Jest (for test driven development) along with error handling and more. Northcoders News has articles which are divided into topics. Each article has user curated ratings using the buttons UI, which triggers calls to the API.
